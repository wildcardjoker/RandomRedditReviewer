Random Reddit Reviewer
======================

About
-----
A small application I created to poll reddit.com/r/random and, optionally, reddit.com/r/randnsfw.

------------
1. Select the number of random subreddits to poll.
2. Decide whether you want to include NSFW subreddits. You can choose:

    * No NSFW subreddits
    * Include NSFW subreddit - has a 505 chance of returning a NSFW subreddit.
    * NSFW only - only return NSFW subreddits.

3. Click on the -Get Subreddits- button
4. A list of subreddits will be displayed below.
